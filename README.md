This repository stores code related to my research on informal urbanization dynamics
The first model I have created in Netlogo represents a housing block where households upgrade the construction state of its houses depending on the construction states of their neighbors that is a proxy of socio-economic conditions. Thus influence is driving house upgrading. The algorithm is an epidemic mechanism called SIRS (Succeptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible)
